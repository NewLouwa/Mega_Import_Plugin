# MEGA Import Plugin Technical Debt

## Status: [CURRENT]
Last Updated: 2024-11-14
Version: 1.1.0

## Introduction
This document tracks known technical debt, planned improvements, and technical risks for the MEGA Import plugin.

## Executive Summary
Systematic tracking of technical compromises, future improvements, and potential risks to guide development priorities and ensure long-term maintainability.

## Key Points
- Identified technical debt items
- Prioritized improvement plans
- Known technical risks
- Timeline for addressing critical items

## Current Technical Debt

### Code Structure
1. **Non-Standard Plugin Structure** (HIGH)
   - Current implementation doesn't match successful plugin patterns
   - **Resolution Plan**: Refactor to external RPC plugin structure by 2024-11-30
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: Successful plugins like filemonitor use RPC structure

2. **JavaScript-Only Implementation** (HIGH)
   - Current implementation doesn't leverage native performance benefits for file operations
   - **Resolution Plan**: Migrate to Go backend for file operations by 2024-12-15
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: High-performance plugins use Go (filemonitor, stashai)

3. **Direct DOM Manipulation** (MEDIUM)
   - Some components use direct DOM access instead of React patterns
   - **Resolution Plan**: Refactor to use React refs and proper lifecycle methods by 2024-12-10
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: Clean React patterns in visage and TPDBMarkers

### API Integration
1. **Rate Limiting Handling** (MEDIUM)
   - No proper handling of API rate limits
   - **Resolution Plan**: Implement rate limiting and retry logic by 2024-11-25
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: Observed proper error handling in filemonitor

2. **Error Handling** (HIGH)
   - Incomplete error handling for API responses
   - **Resolution Plan**: Implement comprehensive error handling by 2024-11-20
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: Robust error handling with user feedback in successful plugins

### User Experience
1. **Loading States** (MEDIUM)
   - Missing loading indicators during operations
   - **Resolution Plan**: Add proper loading states by 2024-11-18
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: All successful plugins implement loading indicators

2. **Settings Management** (HIGH)
   - Basic settings implementation without validation
   - **Resolution Plan**: Implement robust settings management by 2024-12-05
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: Comprehensive settings management in filemonitor

## Planned Improvements

1. **Cross-Platform Binary Distribution** (HIGH)
   - Implement build pipeline for Windows, macOS, and Linux binaries
   - Target: 2024-12-20
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: filemonitor and stashai include platform-specific binaries

2. **Toast Notification System** (MEDIUM)
   - Implement toast notifications for user feedback
   - Target: 2024-11-22
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: All successful plugins use toast notifications

3. **Plugin Auto-Update** (LOW)
   - Add auto-update capability for plugin binaries
   - Target: 2025-01-15
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: Not widely implemented but would be beneficial

## Technical Risks

1. **MEGA API Changes** (MEDIUM)
   - Risk: MEGA.nz API changes could break functionality
   - Mitigation: Implement version checking and graceful degradation
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: Version checking implemented in successful plugins

2. **Browser Memory Limitations** (HIGH)
   - Risk: Large file operations exceed browser memory limits
   - Mitigation: Move to external RPC plugin architecture with Go backend
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: High-performance plugins use external processing

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** (MEDIUM)
   - Risk: Different behavior across operating systems
   - Mitigation: Standardized filesystem access through Go standard library
   - **Insight from Existing Plugins**: Successful plugins handle cross-platform issues well
